# Space Invaders JAX

Reinforcement Learning Agent Playing Space Invaders ðŸš€ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘¾

## Roadmap

- [x] Play space invader with keyboard input (nothing intelligent)
- [x] Read a little about playing atari games with Reinforcement Learning (this will help us decide which algorithm to implement)
- [x] Implementing NN (using JAX) & try if it works (maybe training MNIST or any other small dataset)
- [ ] Integrate the aforementioned NN to space invaders
- [ ] Train
- [ ] Compute cumulative rewards and check if the algorithm is working

# Space Invaders JAX

Reinforcement Learning Agent Playing Space Invaders ðŸš€ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘¾

## Roadmap

[x] Play space invader with keyboard input (nothing intelligent)
[ ] Read a little about playing atari games with Reinforcement Learning (this will help us decide which algorithm to implement)
[ ] Implementing NN (using JAX) & try that it works (maybe training MNIST or any other small dataset)
[ ] Integrate the aforementioned NN to space invaders
[ ] Train
[ ] Compute cumulative rewards and check if the algorithm is working
